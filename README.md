# Game Of Life - Group 10
This repository contains implementations for conway's game of life in Go, Perl and Ruby with bugs (:bug:) in them. It also has materials to perform experimentation to rank the languages based on how easy or hard it is to de:bug: them. The script for each experimentation instance with a participant is given in the following section. 


## Script for experimentation
Thank you for taking part in this experiment. There are 3 implementations of game of life in different languages and each implementation has 2 small bugs which needs to be corrected. Your goal is to debug each implementation.

Please follow the steps below and share your browser window throughout this whole experiment which will help us analyze each language.
- Select the Go folder. Inside the folder open 'gol_bug.go' file and copy the contents. Go to 'https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_golang_online.php' where you will be able to execute your code which you just copied. If you made the correct changes it should print "Test Passed" after you execute and than you can come back and continue.
- Select the Perl folder. Inside the folder open 'gol_bug.pl' file and copy the contents. Go to 'https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_perl_online.php' where you will be able to execute your code which you just copied. If you made the correct changes it should print "Tests Passed" after you execute and than you can come back and continue.
- Select the Ruby folder. Inside the folder open 'gol_bug.rb' file and copy the contents. Go to 'https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_ruby_online.php' where you will be able to execute your code which you just copied. If you made the correct changes it should print "Tests Passed" after you execute and than you can back and continue.
- Fill a survey form using the link 'https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NVK58XD'

We really appreciate you taking the time out for the experiment. Thank you.
