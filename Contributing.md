## Purpose of Contributing
* Maintain our product quality
* Fix bugs and problems
* Engage the community in working toward the best possible to our product
## Code of Conduct
All contributors should abide by the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read this carefully before contributing.

## Pull Request Submission Guidelines
###  Install Git
First thing first, you should install and configure the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your local machine.

[Set Up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart) is a good source for you to set up.

###  Fork Our Repositroy
To contribute code to our product, you must have a Github account so you could push code to your own fork and open Pull Requests in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nazia-alam/SoftwareEngineeringHW1)
### Work On Your Own branch
Once done and you have the code locally on the disk, you can get started. We advice to not work directly on the master branch, but to create a separate branch for each issue you are working on. That way you can easily switch between different work, and you can update each one for latest changes on upstream master individually.
### Write Code
For writing the code and git commit messages just follow our [Style guide](#Style-guide). If there is something unclear of the style, just look at existing code which might help you to understand it better.

## Style Guide 
### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
    
### Documentation Style Guide  
* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

### Python Style Guide
* Use [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) as linter for Python codes
* Give function and variable names as words in lowercase seperated by underscores for e.g. create_keras_model()
* Make the first letter of a class name capital
* Try to select class, function and variable names that are meaningful wherever possible instead of using names like x, y, a etc
