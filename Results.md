# Methods
Each language's buggy code has two bugs. One is a compilation bug to test how easy it is to follow the compiler's error message and the second is a logical bug to check how easy it is to grasp and understand the syntax of the language.

For any type of analysis to happen, we have to first collect data!

Participants in the experiment will give us the following points:

Languages the participant is familiar with.
How familiar the participant is with Go, Perl and Ruby.
Rank the languages based on how easy it was to debug among the three languages.
While the participants are debuging the code in each language we will gather the following data:

Debug time taken in each language.
Number of times the participant ran code for each language.
Based on the data collected we will compare each language and draw our conclusions!
